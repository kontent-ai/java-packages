/**
 * Interface to provide for rendering content item links in rich text.
 * <p>
 * An implementation of this can be provided to via
 * {@link DeliveryClient#setContentLinkUrlResolver(ContentLinkUrlResolver)} to resolve links to a content item that are
 * published.  This is passed on to the {@link RichTextElementConverter} to update {@code href} attributes in links when
 * a {@code data-item-id} is available on the link.
 * <p>
 * This is a {@link FunctionalInterface} to simplify implementation.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following implementation will render {@code <a href="/LINK_TYPE/LINK_URL_SLUG">Some text</a>}:
 * <pre>{@code
 * DeliveryClient deliveryClient = new DeliveryClient("02a70003-e864-464e-b62c-e0ede97deb8c");
 * deliveryClient.setContentLinkUrlResolver(link -> String.format("/%s/%s", link.getType(), link.getUrlSlug()));
 * }</pre>
